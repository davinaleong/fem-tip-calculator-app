## About this Project

I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible with minimal dependencies. This project just uses HTML, CSS & JS. This project uses [NumeralJS](http://numeraljs.com/) for calculation and formatting of the tip amounts.

I like to challenge myself to keep solutions to Frontend Mentor projects as simple as possible, so I can use them in my server-side-rendered projects.
